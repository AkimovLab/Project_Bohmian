# Project_Bohmian
Quantum trajectory calculations made stable with Lorentzian trajectory basis functions


soft.py - run exact calculations

run.py - classical MD

run_cauchy.py - run Bohmian simulations with the option parameterized by 
                the command-line input

run_all.py - run a series of Bohmian calculations (by calling the `run_cauchy` script)
             in a more automated way

Once you have run all the calculations (all the above scripts one by one), you can
start plotting the results using this Jupyter notebook:

plot-all.ipynb

The `.pt` files included here contain the results ofr classical, Bohmian, and exact quantum 
calculations are are ready to be used for plotting
